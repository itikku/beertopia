beertopia
=========

MEAN stack application that uses an external API to find information about some very, very hipster beers

Some valuable information:

When adding a new beer to your list, the external API does a search for the closest match to an existing beer in its database. So, if you're not sure about the name of the beer, just put in a few characters, and the API will do the rest for you!
